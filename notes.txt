Notes
- UniProt ID: protein sequence (FASTA)
- PDB ID: protein structure (3D atomic coordinates)
- setup.py is used to create a package that can be installed with pip
- AF2 downloads weights to run prediction locally 
- alphafold2_ptm = version of AF2 with predicted TM-score, which is a confidence score. ColabFold auto-downloads these
- all of this is happening locally on the backend server
- ptxas is a lib that is needed to compile models for the GPU at runtime
- ColabFold uses ptxas at runtime to compile GPU kernels optimized for your hardware + input
- XLA = accelerated linear algebra, JAX's backend that makes models run fast on GPUs by compiling operations (matmul, conv2d, relu, softmax, etc.)
- PDB 7Z14, the ScNtx complex, has 5 parts- 
    - Chain	Description	                                Type
    - A, D	Acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha	    Receptor (host target)
    - B	    Acetylcholine receptor subunit beta	        Receptor
    - C	    Acetylcholine receptor subunit delta	    Receptor
    - E	    Acetylcholine receptor subunit gamma	    Receptor
    - F, G	Consensus short-chain α-neurotoxin (ScNtx)	Toxin (ligand)
- Chain F (and G) are both the ScNtx toxin, the actual target we want to neutralize- the others are host receptor subunits
- authors focused on chain F because it is the neurotoxin that binds to acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which paralyzes you by blocking ACh from binding, preventing ion channel opening, preventing muscle contraction
- in high enough concentrations, the whole body can be paralyzed
- scoring = estimating how well the binder sticks to the toxin
    - you compute the binding free energy (ΔG) between toxin and binder
    - lower ΔG = stronger interaction = better binding
    - do it right after predicting the binder + protein structures
- thread context switching is a primary bottleneck on large programs, which ours will be at scale
